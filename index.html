		The Mabopane, Winterveld, Soshanguve, and Garankuwa townships were established by the late 1960s, 
		and are now part of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. 
		The formation of these contiguous areas for Africans contributed to the grand apartheid plan – 
		to confine the majority population in peripheral, homeland areas. 
		Together with places such as Babelegi, Rosslyn and Ekandustria, 
		the sites of decentralised industries in and near homelands, 
		such spatially confined townships came to be characterised in terms of ‘displaced urbanisms’.

		Soshanguve(aka Sosha) is a township situated about 30 km north of Pretoria, 
		Gauteng, South Africa. It is home to 403 000 people with the majority being black.
		It is also home to the Tshwane University of Technology(TUT), with thousannds of students flocking to the township every year.
		The name Soshanguve is an acronym for SOtho, SHAngaan, NGUni and VEnda, 
		thus showing the multi-ethnic composition of the population 
		. The major African languages of South Africa are heard in Soshanguve.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The apartheid government divided the Soshanguve residents according to their tribe when they were 
		resettled from Mamelodi and Atteridgeville in 1974. While this was to make admin easy for 
		the apartheid government, it left a community divided and suspicious of each other. 
		More than 20 years later, there are still remnants of the past but there is integration of 
		cultures. The people of Soshanguve arguably are the most multilingual of South Africans.
